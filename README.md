# Overview

This is a static page with dynamic rating of GitHub contributors.
Some of [the most active GitHub users](https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075/)

on weekly basis and put in a table.

The page is designed to motivate its author to work more on
pet projects and be as productive as one of the best programmers in the world.
